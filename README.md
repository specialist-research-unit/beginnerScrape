# Web Scraping

## Please ensure you have the following installed on your computer.


[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
(Please download python 2. As of writing this, that version is 2.7.14)  
Once Python is downloaded, it is really helpful to be able to run python scripts directly from the command line. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU_ca27EGT8) video is a great guide to setting that up.

[Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)  
-You can use the command `pip install beautifulsoup4`  
-pip should be a command you can use out of the box with python. If you run into any troubles, please follow this [guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

Now you should be all ready to go and run this script on your own.  
Just use the command `git clone https://github.com/specialist-research-unit/beginnerScrape` in your command line.  
Then type `cd beginnerScrape` to change into the correct directory.  
Then `python beginnerScrape.py`
